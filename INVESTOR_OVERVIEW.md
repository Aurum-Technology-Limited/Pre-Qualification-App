## üßÆ The Two Core Calculations Explained

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Affordability Calculator** (Income ‚Üí Maximum Loan)

**Business Use Case:** 
"How much can this client borrow based on their income?"

**What It Does:**
Takes a client's income and calculates the maximum loan amount they can afford.

**How It Works:**

```
Step 1: Calculate Affordable Monthly Payment
----------------------------------------
Formula: (Gross Monthly Income √ó DSR Ratio) - Existing Monthly Obligations

Example:
‚Ä¢ Gross Monthly Income: $10,000
‚Ä¢ DSR (Debt Service Ratio): 40% (0.4)
‚Ä¢ Existing Monthly Obligations: $1,500

Affordable Payment = ($10,000 √ó 0.4) - $1,500
                   = $4,000 - $1,500
                   = $2,500/month


Step 2: Calculate Maximum Loan Amount
----------------------------------------
Formula: Present Value of Annuity

Max Loan = P √ó [1 - (1 + r)^(-n)] / r

Where:
‚Ä¢ P = Affordable Monthly Payment ($2,500)
‚Ä¢ r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate √∑ 12)
‚Ä¢ n = Total Number of Payments (Years √ó 12)

Example:
‚Ä¢ Affordable Payment: $2,500/month
‚Ä¢ Interest Rate: 6% per year (0.5% per month)
‚Ä¢ Loan Term: 20 years (240 months)

Max Loan = $2,500 √ó [1 - (1.005)^(-240)] / 0.005
         ‚âà $2,500 √ó 139.58
         ‚âà $348,950
```

**Regulatory Value - DSR (Debt Service Ratio):**
- Industry standard: 40% (banks typically don't lend if debt exceeds 40% of income)
- Protects both lender and borrower from over-leveraging
- Regulatory compliance built-in

**Key Outputs:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum loan amount client qualifies for
- ‚úÖ Monthly payment they can afford
- ‚úÖ Stress-tested amount (see below)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Payment Calculator** (Loan Amount ‚Üí Monthly Payment)

**Business Use Case:**
"The client wants to borrow $350,000 - what will their monthly payment be?"

**What It Does:**
Takes a specific loan amount and calculates the monthly payment required.

**How It Works:**

```
Formula: Loan Amortization (Annuity Payment)
----------------------------------------

Monthly Payment = L √ó [r √ó (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
‚Ä¢ L = Loan Principal Amount
‚Ä¢ r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate √∑ 12)
‚Ä¢ n = Total Number of Payments (Years √ó 12)

Example:
‚Ä¢ Loan Amount: $350,000
‚Ä¢ Interest Rate: 6% per year (0.5% per month)
‚Ä¢ Loan Term: 20 years (240 months)

Monthly Payment = $350,000 √ó [0.005 √ó (1.005)^240] / [(1.005)^240 - 1]
                = $350,000 √ó 0.007164
                = $2,507.50/month

Total Interest Paid = ($2,507.50 √ó 240) - $350,000
                    = $601,800 - $350,000
                    = $251,800
```

**Key Outputs:**
- ‚úÖ Monthly payment amount
- ‚úÖ Total amount paid over life of loan
- ‚úÖ Total interest paid
- ‚úÖ Stress-tested payment (see below)

## üî• **Stress Testing** - The Competitive Advantage

### What Is Stress Testing?

A **regulatory requirement** by central banks to ensure borrowers can still afford their loan if interest rates rise.

**Regulatory Context:**
- Post-2008 financial crisis requirement
- Banks must verify borrowers can handle rate increases
- Typically adds 200-300 basis points (2-3%) to current rates

### How Our Stress Test Works:

```
Example: Affordability with Stress Test
----------------------------------------
Base Scenario:
‚Ä¢ Income: $10,000/month
‚Ä¢ Base Rate: 6%
‚Ä¢ Max Loan: $348,950

Stress Scenario (Add 200 bps = 2%):
‚Ä¢ Same Income: $10,000/month
‚Ä¢ Stress Rate: 8% (6% + 2%)
‚Ä¢ Stress Max Loan: $308,450

Result: Client qualifies for $308,450 under stress conditions
Impact: $40,500 reduction (11.6% lower)

---

Example: Payment Calculation with Stress Test
----------------------------------------
Base Scenario:
‚Ä¢ Loan: $350,000
‚Ä¢ Base Rate: 6%
‚Ä¢ Monthly Payment: $2,507.50

Stress Scenario (Add 200 bps):
‚Ä¢ Same Loan: $350,000
‚Ä¢ Stress Rate: 8%
‚Ä¢ Stress Payment: $2,928.11

Result: Payment increases by $420.61/month (16.8% higher)
```

**Business Value:**
- ‚úÖ Regulatory compliance built-in
- ‚úÖ Reduces default risk for lenders
- ‚úÖ Protects borrowers from future rate shocks
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates responsible lending
