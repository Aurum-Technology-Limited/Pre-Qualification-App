## üßÆ Two Core Calculations

### 1. **Affordability Calculator** (Income ‚Üí Maximum Loan)
**Purpose:** "How much can the client borrow based on their income?"

**Inputs:**
- Gross Monthly Income
- Debt Service Ratio (DSR) - typically 40%
- Existing Monthly Obligations
- Interest Rate
- Loan Term

**Process:**
1. Calculate affordable monthly payment: `(Income √ó DSR) - Existing Obligations`
2. Convert to maximum loan using present value of annuity formula
3. Apply stress test (regulatory requirement - adds 2-3% to rate)

**Example:** $10,000/month income ‚Üí $348,950 max loan (at 6% for 20 years)

---

### 2. **Payment Calculator** (Loan Amount ‚Üí Monthly Payment)
**Purpose:** "What will the monthly payment be for this loan?"

**Inputs:**
- Desired Loan Amount
- Interest Rate
- Loan Term

**Process:**
1. Calculate monthly payment using standard amortization formula
2. Calculate total interest over life of loan
3. Apply stress test to show payment under higher rates

**Example:** $350,000 loan ‚Üí $2,507/month (at 6% for 20 years)

---

## üìê Core Formulas

**Maximum Loan (Affordability):**
```
Max Loan = P √ó [1 - (1 + r)^(-n)] / r
Where: P = affordable payment, r = monthly rate, n = payments
```

**Monthly Payment:**
```
Payment = L √ó [r √ó (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
Where: L = loan amount, r = monthly rate, n = payments
```

**Stress Test:** Add 200-300 basis points (2-3%) to interest rate and recalculate
