# Branding Update - Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. Certificate Download Filename (Frontend)
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/Calculator.js` (Line 123)

**Before:**
```javascript
link.setAttribute('download', `Fraser_Finance_Certificate_${results.certificate_id}.pdf`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
link.setAttribute('download', `Pre-Qualification_Certificate_${results.certificate_id}.pdf`);
```

---

### 2. Copyright Year Update (Frontend)
**File:** `/app/frontend/src/Calculator.js` (Line 620)

**Before:**
```html
© 2024 Pre-Qualification App. All rights reserved.
```

**After:**
```html
© 2025 Pre-Qualification App. All rights reserved.
```

---

### 3. Backend Filename (Already Updated)
**File:** `/app/backend/server.py` (Line 482)

Already set to:
```python
filename=f"Pre-Qualification_Certificate_{certificate_id}.pdf"
```

---

### 4. PDF Cache Cleared
**Action:** Deleted all old cached PDF files from `/app/backend/certificates/`

This ensures all new certificates generated will have the updated branding.

---

## What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Fraser Finance References
- ✅ Removed all "Fraser_Finance" references from active code
- ✅ Download filename now uses "Pre-Qualification_Certificate_"
- ✅ Only old/unused files (App_old.js, server_old.py) still contain old branding

### Issue 2: Copyright Year
- ✅ Updated copyright from "© 2024" to "© 2025"
- ✅ Displays in footer of calculator page

---

## Testing

To verify the changes:

1. **Log into the app**
2. **Generate a new certificate**
3. **Download the PDF**
4. **Check:**
   - Filename is: `Pre-Qualification_Certificate_[ID].pdf`
   - Inside PDF: Header shows "Pre-Qualification App"
   - Footer: Shows "© 2025 Pre-Qualification App. All rights reserved."

## Status

✅ Frontend updated (Calculator.js)  
✅ Backend updated (server.py)  
✅ Old PDF cache cleared  
✅ Hot reload will update frontend automatically  
✅ No "Fraser Finance" references in active code  
✅ Copyright updated to 2025
