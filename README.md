## üìê Calculation Formulas

### Affordability Assessment (Path A)

Calculates the maximum loan amount a borrower can afford based on their financial situation.

#### Formula Breakdown:

1. **Calculate Affordable Monthly Payment**:
   ```
   Affordable Payment = (Gross Monthly Income √ó DSR) - Existing Monthly Obligations
   ```
   - **DSR**: Debt Service Ratio (typically 0.1 to 0.8 or 10% to 80%)
   - **Example**: Income $30,000 √ó 40% DSR = $12,000 - $4,000 obligations = $8,000

2. **Calculate Maximum Loan Amount** (Annuity Formula):
   ```
   Max Loan = Affordable Payment √ó [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]
   ```
   Where:
   - `r` = monthly interest rate (annual rate √∑ 12)
   - `n` = total number of payments (years √ó 12)
   - `(1 + r)^-n` = discount factor

   **Special Case**: If interest rate = 0:
   ```
   Max Loan = Affordable Payment √ó n
   ```

3. **Example Calculation**:
   - Affordable Payment: $8,000
   - Annual Rate: 12% ‚Üí Monthly Rate: 1% (0.01)
   - Term: 20 years ‚Üí Payments: 240
   
   ```
   Max Loan = $8,000 √ó [(1 - (1.01)^-240) / 0.01]
            = $8,000 √ó 90.819416
            = $726,555.33
   ```

### Payment Calculation (Path B)

Calculates the monthly payment required for a given loan amount.

#### Formula:
```
Monthly Payment = Principal √ó [r √ó (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]
```

Where:
- `Principal` = loan amount
- `r` = monthly interest rate
- `n` = number of monthly payments
- `(1 + r)^n` = compound interest factor

**Special Case**: If interest rate = 0:
```
Monthly Payment = Principal / n
```

#### Example Calculation:
- Principal: $800,000
- Annual Rate: 12% ‚Üí Monthly Rate: 1% (0.01)
- Term: 20 years ‚Üí Payments: 240

```
Monthly Payment = $800,000 √ó [0.01 √ó (1.01)^240] / [(1.01)^240 - 1]
                = $800,000 √ó [0.01 √ó 10.892554] / [9.892554]
                = $800,000 √ó 0.011011
                = $8,808.69
```

### Stress Testing

Applies additional interest rate to test loan viability under adverse conditions.

#### Formula:
```
Stressed Rate = Base Annual Rate + (Stress Basis Points / 10,000)
```

**Example**:
- Base Rate: 12% (0.12)
- Stress: 200 basis points
- Stressed Rate: 0.12 + (200 / 10,000) = 0.12 + 0.02 = 0.14 (14%)

#### Impact on Affordability:
```
Reduction % = [(Base Max Loan - Stressed Max Loan) / Base Max Loan] √ó 100
```

**Example**:
- Base Max Loan: $726,555
- Stressed Max Loan (14%): $643,335
- Reduction: (83,220 / 726,555) √ó 100 = 11.45%

#### Impact on Payments:
```
Increase % = [(Stressed Payment - Base Payment) / Base Payment] √ó 100
```

**Example**:
- Base Payment (12%): $8,808.69
- Stressed Payment (14%): $9,948.17
- Increase: (1,139.48 / 8,808.69) √ó 100 = 12.94%

### Additional Metrics

#### Total Amount Paid:
```
Total Paid = Monthly Payment √ó Number of Payments
```

#### Total Interest Paid:
```
Total Interest = Total Paid - Principal
```
