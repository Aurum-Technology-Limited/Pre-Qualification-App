The AI engineer started with an empty repository and built the Fraser Finance - Pre-Qualification Certificate Calculator from scratch based on a provided Markdown document. The initial build included a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React frontend with Tailwind CSS. Key features like calculation paths (Affordability and Payment), stress testing, multi-currency support, PDF generation, and basic certificate storage were implemented.

A significant phase involved troubleshooting frontend-backend communication issues in a containerized environment, resolved by implementing a React proxy and using relative API paths. The app was renamed to Pre-Qualification App, and the database was migrated from MongoDB to Supabase, requiring schema adjustments and RLS policies. Supabase email-password authentication was then integrated, followed by comprehensive documentation and dark mode implementation. Throughout the process, the AI engineer showed strong debugging skills, particularly with environment and proxy configurations.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Fraser Finance - Pre-Qualification Certificate Calculator (later renamed to Pre-Qualification App) capable of two core calculation paths:
1.  **Affordability to Max Loan**: Based on gross monthly income, Debt Service Ratio (DSR), existing monthly obligations, interest rate, and loan term.
2.  **Loan to Payment**: Calculate monthly payments for a specified principal amount.

Key features include stress testing, multi-currency support (TTD, USD), PDF certificate generation with branding, PITIA calculations, audit logging (basic storage for MVP), and unique certificate IDs with configurable validity. Branding colors were specified: Lime Green (#32CD32), White (#FFFFFF), and Accent Dark Green (#228B22).

Subsequent requirements included:
-   Focus on core functionality (no user authentication initially, then added).
-   PDF download only for MVP (no email delivery).
-   Basic certificate storage for MVP (full audit trail later).
-   Deployment-ready application.
-   Inclusion of sample data for testing.
-   E2E testing and bug fixing.
-   Renaming the app to Pre-Qualification App.
-   Migrating the database from MongoDB to Supabase, including table creation instructions and user account creation with Supabase email-password authentication, along with RLS for user-specific data.
-   Comprehensive documentation (technical, API, PRD, formulas).
-   Dark mode implementation with a toggle.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth), 
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, , 
-   **Database**: MongoDB (initial), Supabase (final) for certificate storage and user authentication (RLS).
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for service management, React proxy for local dev.
-   **PDF Generation**: Python library (e.g., ReportLab/WeasyPrint indirectly mentioned, implemented in backend).

<code_architecture>


-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application. Initially handled calculations, PDF generation, and MongoDB operations. Later updated to integrate Supabase for certificate storage, handle JWT verification for authentication, and enforce user-specific RLS.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains environment variables like  (initially), , , , . Critical for database connection and API keys.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Defines Node.js dependencies and scripts. Updated to include  for development server API routing.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Stores frontend environment variables, notably  and . Initially set to , then adjusted to an empty string/relative path with a proxy, then temporarily to  by testing agent, and finally  for preview. Also updated for Supabase credentials.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component. Evolved significantly: initially the main calculator, then a wrapper for authentication ( renamed to ), and further updated to incorporate  for dark mode.
-   **/app/frontend/src/Calculator.js**: The core calculator UI component, extracted from the original . Handles form inputs, API calls, and displaying results. Modified to pass authentication tokens and integrate dark mode.
-   **/app/frontend/src/Auth.js**: New component for user login/signup using Supabase.
-   **/app/frontend/src/AuthContext.js**: React context for managing user authentication state and providing Supabase client.
-   **/app/frontend/src/supabaseClient.js**: Initializes the Supabase client with URL and API key.
-   **/app/frontend/src/setupProxy.js**: Configures the React development server to proxy  requests to the backend, crucial for resolving frontend-backend communication issues in local/preview environments.
-   **/app/frontend/tailwind.config.js**: Tailwind CSS configuration. Updated to include dark mode support and a lime green theme.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Python dependencies. Updated for  and .
-   **/app/PRD.md**, **/app/TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md**, **/app/API_DOCUMENTATION.md**, **/app/README.md**: New documentation files providing comprehensive insights into the application.
-   **/app/TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Documents fixes for deployment issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   No explicit pending tasks were identified by the AI engineer that were not subsequently addressed or documented. The user's last request was to show me the prd here, which was fulfilled.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed the comprehensive documentation phase. This included creating , , , and . The final action was to display the content of  to the user.

The application is currently in a production-ready state with the following features:
-   **Application Name**: Pre-Qualification App.
-   **Core Calculator**: Implements both Affordability and Payment calculation paths, including stress testing and multi-currency support (TTD, USD).
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, connected to Supabase for certificate storage. API endpoints for calculation, certificate generation, and retrieval are protected by JWT authentication using Supabase.
-   **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS, featuring a lime green theme and a fully functional dark mode toggle. It includes login/signup pages using Supabase email-password authentication, and protects the calculator interface after login.
-   **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) is used for storing certificates, with Row Level Security (RLS) enabled to ensure users can only access their own data.
-   **PDF Generation**: Backend generates PDF certificates.
-   **Deployment Readiness**: The application is configured to be deployment-ready, handling frontend-backend communication via a proxy in development and Kubernetes ingress in production.
-   **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation exists for product requirements, technical details, API usage, and deployment.
-   **Bug Fixes**: Previous issues regarding frontend-backend communication (Invalid Host header, WebSocket insecure connection) and Supabase RLS policies have been addressed and validated.
