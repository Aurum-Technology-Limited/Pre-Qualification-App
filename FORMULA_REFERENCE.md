# Quick Formula Reference - Pre-Qualification App

## üìê Mathematical Formulas Used

### 1. Affordability Calculation (Income ‚Üí Maximum Loan)

**Step 1: Affordable Monthly Payment**
```
Affordable_Payment = (Gross_Income √ó DSR_Ratio) - Monthly_Obligations

Where:
‚Ä¢ DSR_Ratio = Debt Service Ratio (typically 0.40 or 40%)
‚Ä¢ This represents the maximum % of income that can go to debt
```

**Step 2: Maximum Loan Amount (Present Value of Annuity)**
```
Max_Loan = P √ó [1 - (1 + r)^(-n)] / r

Where:
‚Ä¢ P = Affordable Monthly Payment
‚Ä¢ r = Monthly Interest Rate = Annual_Rate / 12
‚Ä¢ n = Total Number of Payments = Years √ó 12
```

---

### 2. Payment Calculation (Loan ‚Üí Monthly Payment)

**Monthly Payment (Annuity Payment Formula)**
```
Monthly_Payment = L √ó [r √ó (1 + r)^n] / [(1 + r)^n - 1]

Where:
‚Ä¢ L = Loan Principal Amount
‚Ä¢ r = Monthly Interest Rate = Annual_Rate / 12
‚Ä¢ n = Total Number of Payments = Years √ó 12
```

**Total Interest Paid**
```
Total_Interest = (Monthly_Payment √ó n) - L

Where:
‚Ä¢ n = Total Number of Payments
‚Ä¢ L = Original Loan Amount
```

---

### 3. Stress Testing

**Stress Rate Calculation**
```
Stress_Rate = Base_Rate + (Stress_BPS / 10,000)

Where:
‚Ä¢ Base_Rate = Annual interest rate (decimal form)
‚Ä¢ Stress_BPS = Basis points to add (e.g., 200 for 2%)
‚Ä¢ Divide by 10,000 because 1 basis point = 0.01%

Example:
‚Ä¢ Base Rate: 6% = 0.06
‚Ä¢ Stress: 200 bps
‚Ä¢ Stress Rate = 0.06 + (200/10,000) = 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.08 (8%)
```

Then apply the stressed rate to either:
- **Affordability:** Recalculate Max_Loan with stress_rate
- **Payment:** Recalculate Monthly_Payment with stress_rate

---

### 4. Percentage Changes (Impact Analysis)

**Loan Reduction Under Stress**
```
Reduction_Amount = Base_Loan - Stressed_Loan
Reduction_Percent = (Reduction_Amount / Base_Loan) √ó 100
```

**Payment Increase Under Stress**
```
Increase_Amount = Stressed_Payment - Base_Payment
Increase_Percent = (Increase_Amount / Base_Payment) √ó 100
```

## üìä Example Walkthrough

### Scenario: Home Buyer Pre-Qualification

**Inputs:**
- Gross Monthly Income: $10,000
- DSR Ratio: 40%
- Existing Monthly Obligations: $1,500
- Interest Rate: 6% per year
- Loan Term: 20 years
- Stress Test: 200 basis points (2%)

---

**AFFORDABILITY CALCULATION:**

**Step 1: Calculate Affordable Payment**
```
Affordable_Payment = ($10,000 √ó 0.40) - $1,500
                   = $4,000 - $1,500
                   = $2,500/month
```

**Step 2: Calculate Maximum Loan (Base Rate 6%)**
```
‚Ä¢ Monthly rate: 6% √∑ 12 = 0.5% = 0.005
‚Ä¢ Number of payments: 20 √ó 12 = 240

Max_Loan = $2,500 √ó [1 - (1.005)^(-240)] / 0.005
         = $2,500 √ó [1 - 0.3021] / 0.005
         = $2,500 √ó 0.6979 / 0.005
         = $2,500 √ó 139.58
         = $348,950
```

**Step 3: Stress Test (8% rate)**
```
‚Ä¢ Stressed rate: 6% + 2% = 8%
‚Ä¢ Monthly rate: 8% √∑ 12 = 0.667% = 0.00667

Stressed_Max_Loan = $2,500 √ó [1 - (1.00667)^(-240)] / 0.00667
                  = $2,500 √ó 123.38
                  = $308,450

Reduction = $348,950 - $308,450 = $40,500 (11.6% lower)
```

**RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ Maximum Loan (Base): $348,950
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Maximum Loan (Stressed): $308,450
- üìâ Stress Impact: -$40,500 (-11.6%)

**PAYMENT CALCULATION:**

Using the base qualification amount of $348,950:

**Step 1: Calculate Monthly Payment (Base Rate 6%)**
```
Monthly_Payment = $348,950 √ó [0.005 √ó (1.005)^240] / [(1.005)^240 - 1]
                = $348,950 √ó 0.007164
                = $2,499.90/month
```

**Step 2: Total Cost**
```
Total_Paid = $2,499.90 √ó 240 = $599,976
Total_Interest = $599,976 - $348,950 = $251,026
```

**Step 3: Stress Test Payment (8% rate)**
```
Stressed_Payment = $348,950 √ó [0.00667 √ó (1.00667)^240] / [(1.00667)^240 - 1]
                 = $348,950 √ó 0.008385
                 = $2,926.40/month

Increase = $2,926.40 - $2,499.90 = $426.50/month (17% higher)
```

**RESULTS:**
- ‚úÖ Monthly Payment (Base): $2,499.90
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monthly Payment (Stressed): $2,926.40
- üìà Stress Impact: +$426.50/month (+17%)

## üßÆ Code Implementation (Python)

### Affordability: Max Loan Calculation
```python
def calculate_max_loan(affordable_payment, annual_rate, term_years):
    """Calculate maximum loan from affordable payment"""
    if annual_rate == 0:
        return affordable_payment * term_years * 12
    
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
    num_payments = term_years * 12
    
    max_loan = affordable_payment * (1 - (1 + monthly_rate) ** (-num_payments)) / monthly_rate
    
    return round(max_loan, 2)
```

### Payment Calculation
```python
def calculate_monthly_payment(principal, annual_rate, term_years):
    """Calculate monthly payment using annuity formula"""
    if annual_rate == 0:
        return principal / (term_years * 12)
    
    monthly_rate = annual_rate / 12
    num_payments = term_years * 12
    
    payment = principal * (monthly_rate * (1 + monthly_rate) ** num_payments) / \
              ((1 + monthly_rate) ** num_payments - 1)
    
    return round(payment, 2)
```
